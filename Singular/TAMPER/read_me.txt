Much like Brian Moore chose to use the Google Chrome Tampermonkey extension,

I will be doing the same.


It just makes the most practical sense.

Tech employees already have the extension and if not,

we should utilize it for the scripting functionality it offers all of us.

Automation saves time and makes our lives easier. Let's do that!

Type your login info in one spot, Tampermonkey can fling your credentials

across all of our systems and auth you.

From there, it can automatically load info, parse it and print it to your screen

in a lovely and friendly display.

To better simplify your life.

I am planning on adding support for:

mail.grcc.edu (GroupWise)
csprod
itsupport (eHelpDesk)
Cisco Finesse
Would be nice to also add support for Google Hangouts.
Setup Google Hangouts somewhat similar to Facebook messenger.

I will be working through Brian's script to use as an example. He has already done
a lot of great work.
